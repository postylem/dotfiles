# Pandoc Markdown Previewer

A plugin [PandocPreviewer.vim](../plugin/PandocPreviewer.vim) for taking notes in markdown and previewing as nice HTML.

For an example, see [pandocpreviewing.md](pandocpreviewing.md), which is [rendered as HTML](pandocpreviewing.md.html) (you can preview the html [with githack](https://raw.githack.com/postylem/dotfiles/main/.config/nvim/PandocPreviewer/pandocpreviewing.md.html).  _Note: to render this example, I used pandoc's `--self-contained` flag, so the resulting file contains all the required styling.  Normally I omit this for _much_ more space-efficient HTML files with external CSS, but that wouldn't work for this demonstration._
