# Pandoc Markdown Previewer
Taking notes in markdown and previewing as HTML.

See [pandocpreviewing.md](pandocpreviewing.md), which is [rendered as HTML](pandocpreviewing.md.html) (if you're looking at this on GitHub, you could preview the html [with githack](https://raw.githack.com/postylem/dotfiles/main/.config/nvim/PandocMarkdownPreviewer/pandocpreviewing.md.html), but it doesn't show the CSS formatting).
