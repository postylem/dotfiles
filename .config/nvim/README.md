# neovim config

I started this config based on [jdhao](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config)'s
(really nicely arranged and well commented). Your config is personal, of course,
and I've also gotten bits from other places that I should probably remember.

The main plugins I like are:
- [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) - absolutely lovely, for all TeXing needs
- [Ultisnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) - for fast snippet autocompletion
- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - for nice git integration
- [markdown-preview.nvim](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) - for
  _awesome_ markdown live-previewing while editing (don't need to `:w`!)

Check them out.
